# sapui5-SingleToSplitAppNavigation
Project to explain Routing between single Page App to Split App and back to Single Page App

The Welcome page has 2 tiles. 
1. Tile Employees will take you to a Master Detail Split App.
2. Tile Categories will continue App in Single Page.

It is possible to Navigate to Split App from tile 1 and then go to a single Page (i.e same function as of Tile 2).

It will help understand how routing can be used.

Possible scenarios:

1. Home -> Employees Split App -> Master -> Detail 
2. Home -> Categories List
3. Home -> Employees Split App -> Master -> Detail -> Categories -> Home
